<h1 id="setting-up">Setting up paperpAlfred</h1>

1. Download the workflow from Github and double-click to install paperpAlfred

2. Download your Paperpile library 
	- in Paperpile, cogwheel > Settings > Export > Export to JSON
<img src='images/pp_json.png' width="500">

3. Set the `PAPLIBRARY` path
- Copy the library file path to the clipboard

	- In Finder, right-click the file, press option (‚å•), the select `Copy [FileName] as Pathname`
	- Open the 'Configure Workflow' window in paperpAlfred preferences
	- set path to library as the `Paperpile Library` value

4. _Optional:_ Set `Paperpile Path` (Path to Paperpile in Google Drive)
	- this will allow to open PDFs in the system viewer
	
5. _Optional:_ change the max number of results returned (default: 99)
	- Set the `MAXRESULTS` value in the 'Configure Workflow' window in paperpAlfred 
	- Set the `Key Prefix` (citekey prefix) in the 'Configure Workflow' window in paperpAlfred 

6. _Optional:_ Setup hotkeys to launch 
	- main search 
	- filter by label 
	- filter by folder
	- filter by type


<h1 id="basic-usage">Basic Usage</h1>

## Simple search
- launch paperpAlfred by typing `ppp` or using an optional hotkey
- words or names will be searched across all fields

### Filter by label first
- entering `ppl`  (or optional hotkey) will show a list of labels, the number of items in each label, and the count of item types
- select the label by pressing `return`. PaperpAlfred will now search within that label
	- `option-return (‚å•‚èé)` will open the label in Paperpile
### Filter by folder first
- entering `ppf` (or optional hotkey) will show a list of folders, the number of items in each folder, and the count of item types
- select the folder by pressing `return`. PaperpAlfred will now search within that folder. 
	- `option-return (‚å•‚èé)` will open the folder in Paperpile
- Note: Added feature ‚úÖ the Paperpile web interface does not allow to search by folder
### Filter by type first
- entering `ppty` will show a list of publication types and the number of items in each
- select the folder by pressing `return`. paperpAlfred will now search within that item type
	- `shift-return (‚áß‚èé)` will open the folder in Paperpile
       
## Advanced search
- enter `field:`, where `field` is any of the fields below. Example: `year:2022`
	- `title`
	- `abstract`
	- `citekey`
	- `first` first author
	- `last` last author
	- `journal`
	- `folder`
	- `label`
	- `pmid`
	- `year`
	- `type` publication type

<h1 id="output">Output</h1>
- Alfred returns the top 99 results, numbered. The max number of results returned can be set in Preferences (see [Setting up](#setting-up))
- results are sorted by year (most recent first). Adding `--a` to the query will invert this order. 
- The main text will return the title.
- the subtext will return the following: 
	- record count/total result count
	- üìúif a PDF is available
	- short ID string (first-last author, journal, year)
	- associated labels

## Acting on results
Once the right item is found, the user has seven options to act on it:
1. `return (‚èé)` will open the PDF in the system viewer (Preview for most users), provided that the `PAPPATH` has been set (see [Setting up](#setting-up)). Rarely this might not work (see [Known Issues](#known-issues))
2. `shift-return (‚áß‚èé)` will show the **abstract** and copy it to clipboard
3. `control-return (‚åÉ‚èé)` will show the **complete reference** and copy it to the clipboard
4. `option-return (‚å•‚èé)` will copy a **short reference** (First-last author, journal, year, PMID) to the clipboard
5. `command-return (‚åò‚èé)` will copy the **citation key** to the clipboard
6. `command-shift-return (‚åò‚áß‚èé)` will open the PDF in Google drive
7. `command-option-return (‚åò‚å•‚èé)` will open the record in Paperpile

<h1 id="known-issues">Known Issues</h1>

- incomplete records will not be imported
- special characters (e.g. √º) will need to be entered in order to match the record
- File opening is currently using a name search. The Paperpile file naming logic is not entirely clear to me, the folder structure is deprecated and there might be a small number of cases where the PDF might not be retrievable via paperpAlfred. Google drive view should still work in these cases. 
- Currently tested mainly with research papers, reviews etc. There might be untested use cases for other types of publications. 
- label and folder search in the main window (i.e. using `label:` and `folder:`) will not be exact matches (e.g. AD will also return GWAS_AD). Match will be exact when starting from folder and label window.
